                <h2> Missile Man of India </h2>
                <p><b> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR </b>(15 October 1931
                     - 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace 
                    scientist and statesman who served as the <b>11th</b> president 
                    of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in 
                    Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace 
                    engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist 
                    and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research 
                    and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research 
                    Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's 
                    civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.
                    [1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his 
                    work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle 
                    technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, 
                    technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear 
                    tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by 
                    India in 1974.

                    <!-- Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 
                    with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party 
                    and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely 
                    referred to as the "People's President",[6] he returned to 
                    his civilian life of education, writing and public service 
                    after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious 
                    awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</p> -->
